- [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/install/) (3.2 or higher)


## Installing Dependencies

Before running the project, make sure to install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`. Since we haven't uploaded certain files (e.g., Tailwind CSS library and Node modules), you will need to set up the front-end dependencies.


1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Arslanamin404/BlogWebApp.git
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activating virtual environment On Windows: 
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Activating virtual environment On Mac: 
```bash 
source venv/bin/activate
```


3. Install Python packages `*`: 
  ```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running the Project

 Now that you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can run the Django development server to start the project.

1. Apply database migrations:
```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
```


2. Start the development server:
```bash
  python manage.py runserver
```
